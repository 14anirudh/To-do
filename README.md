## Usage

## TaskList and Updation Of tasks

In the To Do List App you can easily indicate whether tasks are done or not by using the provided checkboxes to each task. Here's how it works;

=> When you see a list of tasks, in the TaskList component you will notice a checkbox beside each task item.

=> To mark a task as complete simply click on the checkbox corresponding to that task. When the checkbox is checked it means the task is considered completed.

=> If you want to change a completed task to incomplete just click on the checkbox again to uncheck it. This action will restore the tasks completion status as incomplete.

=> Completed tasks are visually differentiated from ones by applying an effect to their text. This formatting serves as a cue, for identifying completed tasks.

=> The status of tasks being complete or incomplete is dynamically. Saved using React state. This ensures that your changes persist when you switch between pages or refresh the application.

## Prioritization of Tasks

=> High Priority tasks are marked with red,Medium Priority tasks with yellow,and Low Priority with Green for distinguation

Now you can efficiently manage your tasks and keep track of their completion status with ease!
