## Usage

## Completion of Tasks

In the To-Do List App, you can easily mark tasks as completed or incomplete using the provided checkboxes next to each task. Here's how it works:

=> When you have a list of tasks displayed in the `TaskList` component, you'll notice a checkbox next to each task item.

=> To mark a task as completed, simply click the checkbox corresponding to that task. When the checkbox is checked, the task will be considered as completed.

=> To mark a completed task as incomplete, click the checkbox again to uncheck it. This action will revert the task's completion status to incomplete.

=> Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete tasks with a strike-through effect applied to the task text. This styling provides a clear visual indicator of the task's completion status.

=> The completion status of tasks is dynamically updated and stored using React state, ensuring that your changes persist even when you navigate between pages or reload the application.

## Prioritization of Tasks

=> High Priority tasks are marked with red,Medium Priority tasks with yellow,and Low Priority with Green for distinguation

Now you can efficiently manage your tasks and keep track of their completion status with ease!
